# This is the default ansible 'hosts' file.
#
# It should live in /etc/ansible/hosts
#
#   - Comments begin with the '#' character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups
#
# Host variables
#
# ansible_ssh_host
#   The name of the host to connect to, if different from the alias you wish to give to it.
# ansible_ssh_port
#   The ssh port number, if not 22
# ansible_ssh_user
#   The default ssh user name to use.
# ansible_ssh_pass
#   The ssh password to use (this is insecure, we strongly recommend using --ask-pass or SSH keys)
# ansible_sudo_pass
#   The sudo password to use (this is insecure, we strongly recommend using --ask-pass or SSH keys)
# ansible_connection
#   Connection type of the host. Candidates are local, ssh or paramiko.  The default is paramiko before Ansible 1.2, and 'smart' afterwards which detects whether usage of 'ssh' would be feasible based on whether ControlPersist is supported.
# ansible_ssh_private_key_file
#   Private key file used by ssh.  Useful if using multiple keys and you don't want to use SSH agent.
# ansible_python_interpreter
#   The target host python path. This is useful for systems with more
#   than one Python or not located at "/usr/bin/python" such as \*BSD, or where /usr/bin/python
#   is not a 2.X series Python.  We do not use the "/usr/bin/env" mechanism as that requires the remote user's
#   path to be set right and also assumes the "python" executable is named python, where the executable might
#   be named something like "python26".
# ansible\_\*\_interpreter
#   Works for anything such as ruby or perl and works just like ansible_python_interpreter.
#   This replaces shebang of modules which will run on that host.

# Ex 1: Ungrouped hosts, specify before any group headers.

ansible               ansible_connection=local
# green.example.com
# blue.example.com:222
# 192.168.100.1
# 192.168.100.10      

# Ex 2: A collection of hosts belonging to the 'webservers' group

[webservers]
# alpha.example.org   ansible_ssh_port=2222       ansible_ssh_user=sysadmin
# beta.example.org
# 192.168.1.100
# 192.168.1.110

# You can assign an alias for hosts not resolvable by DNS or host
# juniper             ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.111
# berries             ansible_ssh_host=nuts.example.com

# If you have multiple hosts following a pattern you can specify
# them like this:

# www[001:006].example.com

# Ex 3: A collection of database servers in the 'dbservers' group

[dbservers]

# db01.intranet.mydomain.net
# db02.intranet.mydomain.net
# 10.25.1.56
# 10.25.1.57

# Here's another example of host ranges, this time there are no
# leading 0s:

# db-[99:101]-node.example.com
